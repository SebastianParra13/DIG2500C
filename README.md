## 3. What experience do you have building websites?

- I have almost no experience building websites. I created one website in High School that was extremely simplistic about the band AC/DC, it was an introduction to computers class in which we created a site with information on the topic. The assignment consisted of editing elements such as background and text colors, adding in pictures, as well as formatting the size and alignment of the text. It was incredibly basic and not very interesting.

## 4. What software experience do you currently have?

- I have only very basic knowledge in the software included in the Adobe Creative Cloud, all of which was learned last semester in the Intro to Digital Media class. Before that I used Gimp quite a bit for photo editing, since it was a free software that worked quite nicely. A software I am much more proficient in is Ableton live 9 Suite. Ableton is a digital audio workstation for music production. It can also be used to edit videos, however that's not its intended use. Ableton is incredibly fun to use but also very difficult to learn due to the shear amount of things is can do.

## 5. What are some of your strongest soft skills?

- When I worked at CVS we were given monthly evaluations in which we were given scores left online by the customers. Frequently my highest was always friendliness. Even though that was in a customer service position, I believe that quality could extend into many different professions, as getting along with fellow employees as well as clients is a helpful asset to have.

## 6. Where do you see yourself working after you complete your studies?

- I'm not sure exactly what I where or what I would like to do after completing my studies. I am greatly interested in the video game industry and plan on focusing on game design later on in the Digital Media Major, however as to what specifically I'm still not certain. Although working for a game development company is my primary choice at the moment, I definitely want to see what opportunities the Digital Media major offers as a whole.
